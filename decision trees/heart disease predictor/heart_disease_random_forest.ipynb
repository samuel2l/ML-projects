    "### HEART DISEASE PREDICTOR\n",
    "From [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)\n",
    "\n",
    "Context\n",
    "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Attribute Information\n",
    "- Age: age of the patient [years]\n",

    "- ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]\n",
    "- Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]\n",
    "- ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]\n",
    "- HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]"
